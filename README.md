BOEING 737-800 Winglets Brief:
------------------------------
FSX/P3D Airbus A330-900 neo in 5 liveries: House colours (F-WTTN), Delta Airlines (N404DX), Hifly (CS-TKY), TAP Portugal (CS-TUF) and a White livery for repaints.
This aircraft is based on the blended winglets model by SAAD, featuring a brand new Airfile and new flight dynamics. All textures are very detailled with new alpha layers. All textures are DXT5. New A3XXneo wide 2D panel V1.0 (with default panel optional).
The VC is the Tom Ruth (TomA333NG_interior) revised Airbus A330-300 VC model. This VC model includes working wipers (right mouse click on switch) and animated sun shades. Switches for LCD Screens, EICAS, PFD, MFD. Auto-brake switch. Realistic integrated FMC.
Updated day and night VC textures. Includes 5 VC camera views, adding Autopilot (centered) and jumpseat, to First officer, Center console and Overhead. Updated MFD now showing Terrain elevation and traffic (TCAS).
Fully working Auto-brake, Fully working Auto-taxi with panel lights, extended functionality for Warning/Caution buttons, fixed Flaps Transit angles in EICAS. Credits to Hiroshi Higami for the original Auto-brake gauge and Daniel Gauthier for the original Cockpit Sounds.
The new panels are using the following extra gauges: FMC by Garret Smith, and VSpeed, Altitude Callout, Icons32 and new Cockpit sounds by myself. Most of these gauges are using the FSX XML Sound gauge by Doug Dawson.
Superb environment sound file using the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB package, with further updates. Tested in FSX Acceleration (DX10) and FSX Steam Edition (DX9). Not tested in P3D but should work correctly up to V3. Sound effects may not work in V4.
